# Visualization

This directory contains screenshots of FAST-LIO SLAM running on a Jetson Xavier NX, showing both the real-time localization process in RViz and the final point cloud maps in CloudCompare.

## RViz Localization Screenshots

These screenshots demonstrate the system performing real-time localization. You can observe:
- The colored point cloud map
- The coordinate frames showing robot position
- The path taken during mapping (red line)
- Transform (TF) tree showing all coordinate frames

## Map Visualization

The CloudCompare visualizations show the final processed maps with:
- Color coding by height/intensity
- Clearly visible structural features
- Cleaned point clouds after noise removal

The quality of these visualizations demonstrates the effectiveness of FAST-LIO for real-time SLAM on the Jetson Xavier NX platform.
